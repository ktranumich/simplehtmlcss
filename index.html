		<p>My previous jobs include work at Bellevue College and Renton Technical College's Disabilities Resources Office. At Bellevue College, I tailored my work to best fit the disabled invidiuals I worked with, accommodating to their specific needs. I acted as their eyes, hands, and ears depending on the situation. I also proctored course exams for them when they needed extra accommodations. It was a very satisfying job and I felt that I was really making an impact on their educations. I knew that I was supporting them and they were always so grateful that they were able to receive accommodations.</p>
		<p>When I needed more hours to work, I started working at Renton Technical College's Disabilities Resources Center. I worked in the evening GED classroom (for working adults coming back to earn their high school diploma) and supported blind students in this venture. It was something that I had no experience with, and neither did the head GED instructor. It was a work in progress and a collaboration with the blind students to figure out what worked best and how we could translate GED materials into something a blind student could understand. This part of my work was deeply satisfying because at first, the blind students themselves had no confidence in themselves that they could succeed. I put in a lot of effort to demonstrate to them that they were indeed capable. It was clear that some students had a bad history with accommodations, and I was determined not to let that happen again while I was supporting them. </p>
