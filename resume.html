	<p>Here's what I am looking forward to in my career. Currently I am applying for User Research internships. With UX, I am fascinated by the synthesis of human factors, psychology, 
		ergonomics, engineering, sociology, and all the other disciplines. With so many theories and areas to learn from, there’s so much open space to innovate, get inquisitive, and get your own ideas into the mix. And with so many different disciplines involved, there’s a lot of ambiguity that comes with UX. It’s a place where I’m never done learning. Where I’m exploring every opportunity and having critiques and discussions because there aren’t gold standards to follow. 
		For me, it’s my emotional investment in real people. I’m always thinking about what I can do to better the people I interact with. I want to bring satisfaction into their lives, and I’ve been able to do that from an educational standpoint so far. Everyone is different, and working under their unique constraints makes for a challenging, satisfying experience. </p>
